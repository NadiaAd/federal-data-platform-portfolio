# Cloud Engineering Portfolio

This section highlights my hands-on experience building and operating AWS infrastructure, focused on secure, scalable environments that support data and application workloads.

## AWS Services Used

- **Compute:** EC2 instances in public and private subnets, Auto Scaling concepts for highly available services. [file:20]
- **Networking:** VPC, subnets, route tables, internet gateways, and security groups for public and private tiers. [file:20]
- **Storage & Databases:** S3 buckets for object storage, RDS/Aurora for relational databases. [file:20]
- **Security & IAM:** IAM users, roles, and policies aligned with least-privilege and NIST-style guidance. [file:20]
- **Monitoring:** CloudWatch metrics and alarms, CloudTrail and Config concepts for visibility and compliance. [file:20]
- **Serverless:** Lambda functions for lightweight automation and event-driven tasks. [file:20]

## What I’ve Built

- Deployed and managed EC2 instances inside a VPC with public and private subnets, using security groups to control access. [file:20]
- Created S3 buckets for storing application artifacts and lab outputs. [file:20]
- Set up CloudWatch alarms (for example, CPU utilization) and SNS email notifications to respond to performance issues. [file:20]
- Experimented with Lambda functions triggered by test events to automate simple responses. [file:20]

## How This Supports the Role

This work demonstrates that I can design and operate core cloud infrastructure components, reason about secure network boundaries, and use monitoring/automation to keep workloads healthy—key expectations for a Solutions Architect / Data Engineer. [cite:41][file:20]
