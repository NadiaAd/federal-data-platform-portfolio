# Data Analysis and SQL

This section showcases my experience working with structured data, performing SQL-based analysis, and delivering insights to stakeholders.

## Professional Data Analysis Experience

- Worked as a Data Insights Analyst using SQL and Excel to analyze large relational datasets, identify trends, and detect anomalies. 
- Produced recurring and ad-hoc reports to monitor key metrics and support data-driven decisions. 
- Developed compliance- and security-focused reports to support data integrity and regulatory adherence. 
- Used Python to help automate data workflows and reduce manual effort in reporting. 

## Skills Demonstrated

- **SQL:** joins, aggregations, filters, data quality checks (duplicates, nulls, out-of-range values). 
- **Spreadsheets:** pivot tables, lookup functions, forecasting scenarios for operational metrics. 
- **Visualization:** dashboards and charts to present findings clearly to non-technical stakeholders. 
- **Quality & Governance:** validation steps to ensure accuracy and consistency of source and report data. 

## How This Supports the Role

These projects and responsibilities show that I can understand data models, write reliable SQL, and design checks that keep data trustworthy—core building blocks for designing and operating robust data pipelines as a Data Engineer.
