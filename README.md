# Federal Data Platform Portfolio

This repository showcases my experience across three main areas that matter for a Solutions Architect / Data Engineer role: cloud infrastructure, data analysis and ETL, and web applications that generate and consume data.

---

## Repository Structure

### `01-cloud/`

Cloud engineering work:

- AWS infrastructure concepts (VPC, subnets, security groups, EC2, S3, RDS, IAM).
- Architecture notes describing a secure two‑tier VPC layout with public and private subnets.
- Monitoring and alerting ideas using CloudWatch metrics and alarms.

See: `01-cloud/architecture-notes.md`

### `02-data-analysis/`

Data analysis and ETL:

- Experience using SQL and spreadsheets to analyze relational datasets, monitor key metrics, and perform data quality checks.
- Python-based ETL example that reads raw order data, cleans it, computes daily revenue, and writes the result to a new dataset.
- Shows how I move from analysis into reproducible, scriptable data workflows.

See: `02-data-analysis/etl_example.py` and `02-data-analysis/raw_orders.csv`

### `03-web-dev/`

Web development projects:

- High-level API design for an e‑commerce backend supporting apps like Fruta e Pan and Burger My Bun.
- Demonstrates how I think about endpoints, authentication, and deployment on AWS.

See: `03-web-dev/api_design.md` and linked repositories (Fruta e Pan, Burger My Bun, Skillup Burger Shop).

### `assets/`

Supporting diagrams and screenshots (for example, AWS console views of VPCs, subnets, EC2, RDS, IAM, and CloudWatch).

### `docs/`

Additional documentation such as role-focused resumes and notes mapping work history to cloud and data responsibilities.

## How This Portfolio Supports a Solutions Architect / Data Engineer Role

- **Cloud:** Shows understanding of secure, scalable AWS network and compute design, plus monitoring and IAM considerations.
- **Data:** Demonstrates SQL and data-analysis skills, along with a concrete Python ETL example that can be scheduled or extended into full pipelines.
- **Applications:** Connects real web applications to backend API designs and cloud deployment patterns, illustrating how user-facing systems interact with data platforms.

This portfolio is a work in progress and will continue to grow with additional Terraform, containerization, and orchestration examples as I deepen my cloud and data engineering practice.
