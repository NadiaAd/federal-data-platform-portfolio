# Web Development Projects

This section highlights web applications I’ve built that can sit on top of cloud and data platforms, showing how I connect frontend experiences to backend services.

## How This Supports the Role

These applications show that I understand how real user-facing systems generate and consume data. They provide practical examples of workloads that can be integrated with the cloud infrastructure and data pipelines described in other sections of this portfolio. [cite:41][file:19][file:20]
